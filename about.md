<!-- ![ about me ](aboutme.jpeg) -->

Hi, I am <em><b>Hetav M.</b></em> (हेतव म.), currently a junior with major in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahmedabad, India. I am interested in using code to build softwares and systems that people can use. I also like to solve DSA related questions. When I am not working, I like cooking, love to read(mostly fiction), and watch youtube videos. Above all, I like to improve myself, a little bit, everyday! 
<br>
<br>
I'm always up for a conversation, you can <a href = "mailto: hetav.1805@gmail.com">email me</a> - either 
about a blog post or anything else.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
