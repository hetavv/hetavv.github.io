<!-- ![ about me ](aboutme.jpeg) -->

Hi, I am <em><b>Hetav M.</b></em> (हेतव म.), currently a senior with major in Computer Science and Engineering from <u><a href="https://nirmauni.ac.in/">Nirma University</a></u>, Ahmedabad, India. I am interested in using code to build softwares and systems that people can use.
<br>
<hr>
 My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence specifically in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in Healthcare. Particularly, I have focussed on wearable and biomedical imaging techniques for early diagnosis of disease. Eventually I would like to work on building preventative medical systems instead of reactive ones. When I am not working, I like cooking, love to read(mostly fiction), and watch youtube videos. Above all, I try to improve myself, a little bit, everyday!
 <br>
 <hr>
Currently, I am a doing part time research at <u><a href="https://stanford-health.github.io/">Wearipedia</a></u> at Stanford University. At Nirma, I am affiliated with <u><a href="https://sudeeptanwar.in/">Sudeep Tanwar Research group</a></u> where I have worked in field of creating clinical decision support system for neurodegenerative diseases using AI. I also spent a summer at <u><a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/asia-pac/home">Northern Trust</a></u>, where I worked in using dynamic timestamp watermark removal from documents using Computer vision.

As a board member of the <u><a href="https://technology.nirmauni.ac.in/student_work/csi/">Computer Society of India</a></u> chapter at Nirma University, I have been involved in organizing various projects and conducted hackathons and workshops. 
<br>

I'm always up for a conversation, you can <u><a href = "mailto: hetav.1805@gmail.com">email me</a></u> - either 
about a blog post or anything else.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
