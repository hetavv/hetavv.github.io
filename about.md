<!-- ![ about me ](aboutme.jpeg) -->

Hi, I am <em><b>Hetav M.</b></em> (हेतव म.), currently a senior with major in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nirmauni.ac.in/">Nirma University</a>, Ahmedabad, India. I am interested in using code to build softwares and systems that people can use. My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence specifically in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in Healthcare. Particularly, I have focussed on wearable and biomedical imaging techniques for early diagnosis of disease. Eventually I would like to work on building preventative medical systems instead of reactive ones. When I am not working, I like cooking, love to read(mostly fiction), and watch youtube videos. Above all, I try to improve myself, a little bit, everyday! 
<br>
Currently, I am a doing part time research at <a href="https://stanford-health.github.io/">Wearipedia</a> at Stanford University. At Nirma, I am affiliated with <a href="https://sudeeptanwar.in/">Sudeep Tanwar Research group</a> where I have worked in field of creating clinical decision support system for neurodegenerative diseases using AI. I also spent a summer at <a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/asia-pac/home">Northern Trust</a>, where I worked in using dynamic timestamp watermark removal from documents using Computer vision.

As a board member of the <a href="https://technology.nirmauni.ac.in/student_work/csi/">Computer Society of India</a> at Nirma University, I have been involved in various projects and conducted hackathons and workshops.
