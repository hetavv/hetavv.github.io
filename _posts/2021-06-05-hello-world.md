`hello world`
<br>
<br>
It only felt apt to name the first blog to be <em>hello world.</em> This is going to be a quick blog post about why this blog and what all I'm planning to post in the near future. But, before that, Hi, I am Hetav M., currently a computer science rising junior and welcome to my blog.
<br>
<b>Strengths:</b> baking, technology, and knowing how to use code from stack overflow
<br>
<b>Weaknesses:</b> free food samples, dogs, and coming up with lists of more than three items
<br>
<h2>Why this blog?</h2>
Putting my work out there will make me more accountable and also just help me document my journey! 
<br>
<h2>What I expect to post? </h2>
Interesting projects I am working on, leetcode solutions and my book recommendations!
<br>
<br>
Thats all for now! I'm always up for a conversation, you can <a href = "mailto: hetav.1805@gmail.com">email me</a> - either about a blog post or anything else.
